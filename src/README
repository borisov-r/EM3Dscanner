#
# This is the source directory of my project called EM3Dscanner
#
# Here I'll try to implement the first version of it.
# The written code should be self explanatory and simple.
#
# It should be written in TDD (test-driven development style) using
# unittest module and logging to keep executions in log file.
#
# Requirements:
#   * ParaView 3.14.x
#   * Python 2.7 or >
#   * unittest module
#   * logging module
#
# All the requirements are implemented in ParaView so it should't be hard
# to find the way for proper implementation.
#
# The output of this software should be generated file with all measured data.
#
# Directory called './old' contains my first approaches to understand ParaView
# and VTK and to adopt the principles for my purposes.
#
# ParaView EM3Dscanner will be set up as macro.
# Install instructions: 1. ParaView / Macro / Add new macro
#                       2. Tools / Python Shell (add dimensions)
#                       3. Macros Toolbars / 3DEMscanner
#
# v.0.0.1 - this will be the simplest implementation:
#           * single frequency scan
#           * single data (magnitude or phase)
#           * single parameter - S11, S21, S12 or S22
#
