Open project for visualization of electromagnetic fields using RepRap, ParaView, Blender, PNAL (Agilent's HF equipment).

Everything here will be licensed under the GNU GPL v3 or (at the user's discretion) any later version.

This project will be part of my PhD Thesis :)

==============================================

The basic idea behind this project is:
1. use RepRap to control the movement of coax probe, connected to VNA or PNA (we may use simple spectrum analyzer later)
2. collect data in VTK compatible format (as .vtk or .vtu) from VNA or PNA (or spectrum analyzer) (data is stored either in structured data format or as XML compatible)
3. visualize the data in ParaView - this will enable the export and analysis of the data to be much easier
4. eventually import it in Blender using .x3d or .vrml formats
