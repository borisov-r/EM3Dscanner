#
# This is the source directory of my project called ParaScan.py
#
# Here I'll try to implement the first version of it.
# The written code should be self explanatory and simple.
#
# It should be written in TDD (test-driven development style) using
# unittest module and logging to keep executions in log file.
#
# Requirements:
#   * ParaView 3.14.x
#   * Python 2.7 or >
#   * unittest module
#   * logging module
#
# All the requirements are implemented in ParaView so it should't be hard
# to find the way for proper implementation.
#
# The output of this software should be generated file with all measured data.
#
#
# From ParaView it should be loaded as a Module and run when called.
#
# I'll try to make it with only two files: ParaScan.py and ParaScanTests.py
#
# Directory called './old' contains my first approaches to understand ParaView
# and VTK and to adopt the principles for my purposes.
